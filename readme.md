# Reflective Standards in Cairo üê´

_Desaf√≠a lo establecido, imagina lo inexplorado y crea caminos donde otros ven callejones sin salida._

## Overview üåê

This repository is dedicated to the exploration and development of reflective standards and assets using the Cairo language. Reflective assets have the unique property of automatically redistributing a portion of transactions to existing holders, creating a self-rewarding mechanism.

## Goals üéØ

- **Translate and Adapt**: Our primary goal (by now) is to translate the well-known `reflect.sol` from Solidity to Cairo, ensuring that the unique properties of reflective assets are preserved and optimized for the Cairo environment.
- **Wrapper**: Coming soon...

## Installation üîß

Before you can set up the project, you'll need to have `scarb` and `starkli` installed on your machine. If you don't have them installed, you can find the installation instructions on the official documentation:

- [Scarb Installation](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/download.html)
- [Starkli Installation](https://github.com/starkware-libs/starkli)

## Project Setup üõ†Ô∏è

Once you have installed `scarb` and `starkli`, it's time to set up the project on your local machine. Follow the steps below:

1. Create a new folder for the project.
```bash
mkdir your_project_name
```
2. Navigate to the new folder in your terminal.
```bash
cd your_project_name
```
3. Clone the repository into your new project folder.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/henryf10h/reflect_cairo.git
```
4. Change directory to the cloned repository.
```bash
cd reflect_cairo
```
5. Now you are ready to build the project using scarb.
```bash
scarb build
```
6. You can also run the provided tests using scarb.
```bash
scarb test
```

Deploying the `reflect.cairo` contract involves a two-step process: declaration and deployment. Below are the steps for both processes along with an explanation of the four arguments required by the contract's constructor.

### Arguments Explanation

The `reflect.cairo` contract constructor requires four arguments:

1. **name**: The name of the token.
2. **symbol**: The symbol of the token.
3. **supply**: The initial supply of the token. It is suggested to use a supply number bigger than 10^12 for better precision.
4. **owner**: The StarkNet address of the initial owner of the tokens.

### 1. Declaration

```bash
starkli declare --watch target/dev/reflect_cairo_REFLECT.sierra.json --account ~/.starkli-wallets/deployer/account.json --keystore ~/.starkli-wallets/deployer/keystore.json
```
### 2. Deployment

Deploy the contract with the desired name, symbol, supply, and owner arguments using the following command:

```bash
starkli deploy --watch 0x06ddeba5578f6f28b0688bfb0b6891a3d50ee8a0a7f8b98d26fd874e710a4674 str:name str:symbol u256:10000000000000000 0x67e6ad8187767ef41f2f3bc225d33d31b37dd9bbee7b628f4b6b16b90d26666 --account ~/.starkli-wallets/deployer/account.json --keystore ~/.starkli-wallets/deployer/keystore.json 
```
Make sure to replace str:name, str:symbol, u256:10000000000000000, and 0x67e6ad8187767ef41f2f3bc225d33d31b37dd9bbee7b628f4b6b16b90d26666 with your desired token name, symbol, supply, and owner address respectively.

üöÄ Wujuuuu! Your contract has been deployed successfully! Feel the excitement as you now have your deflationary token live on StarkNet! üéâ

## Tooling

The following tools are utilized in this project:

- **Starkli**: A CLI tool for interacting with StarkNet.[Starkli](https://book.starkli.rs/)
- **Scarb**: A testing framework for StarkNet contracts. [Scarb](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/docs.html/)
- **Cairo 1.0 VSCode Extension**: An extension for Visual Studio Code to support Cairo language. [Get it here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=starkware.cairo1)
