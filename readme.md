# Reflective Standards in Cairo 🐫

## Overview 🌐

This repository is dedicated to the exploration and development of reflective standards and assets using the Cairo language. Reflective assets have the unique property of automatically redistributing a portion of transactions to existing holders, creating a self-rewarding mechanism.

## Motivation 🚀

Blockchain and smart contracts present a vast, ever-evolving domain. It's pivotal to adapt existing standards and foster innovations like reflective assets, a novelty in decentralized finance (DeFi).

## Goals 🎯

- **Translate and Adapt**: Our primary goal (by now) is to translate the well-known `reflect.sol` from Solidity to Cairo, ensuring that the unique properties of reflective assets are preserved and optimized for the Cairo environment.
  

## Contribution ✨

We welcome contributions from the community! Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started, there's room for everyone to make an impact. If you have ideas, optimizations, you just want to write tests or anything aligned with reflective standards, please feel free to raise an issue or submit a pull request.

## Final Thoughts 💭

Let's come together to create, inspire, and redefine the boundaries of what's possible."
