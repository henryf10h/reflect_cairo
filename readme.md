# Reflective Standards in Cairo üê´
![Description of Image](public/alter.png)
## Overview üåê

This repository is dedicated to the exploration and development of reflective standards and assets using the Cairo language. Reflective assets have the unique property of automatically redistributing a portion of transactions to existing holders, creating a self-rewarding mechanism.

## Motivation üöÄ

Blockchain and smart contracts present a vast, ever-evolving domain. It's pivotal to adapt existing standards and foster innovations like reflective assets, a novelty in decentralized finance (DeFi).

## Goals üéØ

- **Translate and Adapt**: Our primary goal (by now) is to translate the well-known `reflect.sol` from Solidity to Cairo, ensuring that the unique properties of reflective assets are preserved and optimized for the Cairo environment.

## Installation üîß

This project utilizes the scarb package manager for building and testing the contract. If you don't have scarb installed, you can find the installation instructions on the [official documentation](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/download.html).

### Steps:
Install scarb following the [provided guidelines](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/download.html).

## Usage üîß

### Build
```bash
scarb build
```
### Test
```bash 
Help us writing tests !
```
(we highly need help writing tests)

## Deployment

To deploy the `reflect.cairo` contract, follow the steps below:

### 1. Declaration

```bash
starkli declare --watch target/dev/reflect_cairo_REFLECT.sierra.json --account ~/.starkli-wallets/deployer/account.json --keystore ~/.starkli-wallets/deployer/keystore.json
```
### 2. Deployment

```bash
starkli deploy --watch 0x06ddeba5578f6f28b0688bfb0b6891a3d50ee8a0a7f8b98d26fd874e710a4674 str:name str:symbol u256:10000000000000000 0x52e6ad8187767ef41f2f3bc225d33d31b37dd9bbee7b628f4b6b16b90d293ec --account ~/.starkli-wallets/deployer/account.json --keystore ~/.starkli-wallets/deployer/keystore.json 
```
## Tooling

The following tools are utilized in this project:

- **Starkli**: A CLI tool for interacting with StarkNet.[Starkli](https://book.starkli.rs/)
- **Scarb**: A testing framework for StarkNet contracts. [Scarb](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/docs.html/)
- **Cairo 1.0 VSCode Extension**: An extension for Visual Studio Code to support Cairo language. [Get it here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=starkware.cairo1)

## Resources

Here are some resources to get more familiar with the underlying technologies:

- [Technical Paper on Reflect Contracts by Anonymous Builder](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/a-technical-whitepaper-for-reflect-contracts/14297)
- [Cairo Book](https://book.cairo-lang.org/)
- [Cairo by Example](https://cairo-by-example.com/)
- [StarkNet Book](https://book.starknet.io/index.html/)

## Version

The versions of the tools and libraries used are as follows:

```bash
starkli --version
# Output: 0.1.15 (995c95a)
scarb --version
# Output: 0.7.0 (58cc88efb 2023-08-23)
cairo --version
# Output: 2.2.0 (https://crates.io/crates/cairo-lang-compiler/2.2.0)
sierra --version
# Output: 1.3.0
```
