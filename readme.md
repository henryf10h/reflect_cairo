# Reflective Standards in Cairo

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to the exploration and development of reflective standards and assets using the Cairo language. Reflective assets have the unique property of automatically redistributing a portion of transactions to existing holders, creating a self-rewarding mechanism. By bringing this concept to Cairo, we aim to expand the ecosystem of StarkNet and other platforms that utilize Cairo.

## Motivation

The world of blockchain and smart contracts is vast and ever-evolving. As we progress, it's essential to not only adapt existing standards but also to innovate and create what doesn't exist yet. Reflective assets represent one such innovation in the world of decentralized finance. By building these standards in Cairo, we're taking a step towards a more inclusive, efficient, and versatile decentralized ecosystem.

## Goals

- **Translate and Adapt**: Our primary goal is to translate the well-known `reflect.sol` from Solidity to Cairo, ensuring that the unique properties of reflective assets are preserved and optimized for the Cairo environment.
  
- **Develop Public Goods**: We believe in the power of open-source and the importance of creating public goods. Our implementations are intended to serve as a foundation upon which the community can build, expand, and innovate.
  
- **Inspire Innovation**: Beyond mere translation, we aim to inspire the community to think outside the box. What other mechanisms can be introduced? How can reflective properties be combined with other DeFi primitives? The possibilities are endless.

## Contribution

We welcome contributions from the community! Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started, there's room for everyone to make an impact. If you have ideas, optimizations, or new concepts that align with reflective standards, please feel free to raise an issue or submit a pull request.

## Final Thoughts

In the ever-evolving landscape of blockchain and smart contracts, it's the innovations and the forward thinkers that drive progress. Let's come together to create, inspire, and redefine the boundaries of what's possible.
